         <h1> Animal Farm's Characters
         </h1>
         <p> Animal Farm has multiple characters in its story, each representing a different thing in the Soviet Union's early history. Here are some of the more important ones:</p>  <br>
         
         <p>Napoleon: Napoleon is the main character, and villain of the story. He starts off as a normal pig, who believes in Old Major's rules, but after the revolution and his rise to power, he becomes more sinister and controlling. He becomes corrupt, and drunk on power, and he kicks out the other pig leader, Snowball, from the farm. He begins to alter the rules he once believed in, making them more favored towards the pigs, and less favored for the rest of the animals on the farm. He is seen as the representation of Josef Stalin in the book.</p>

         <p>Snowball: Snowball was one half of the first leaders of Animal Farm. He believed in Old Major's rules of Animalism, and fought for the animals during their revolution. It seems that Snowball cared about the other animals' wellbeing. But, he was sadly ousted from the farm by his fellow leader, Napoleon. After being kicked, he isn't seen again in the novel, but is mentioned regularly, and has his legacy tarnished. Napoleon uses him as a scapegoat, saying that one of their projects failed because Snowball interfered, and that people were starting to rebel against him because of Snowball. George Orwell uses him as a way to represent Leon Trotsky.</p>

         <p>Farmer Jones: Farmer Jones is the owner of Manor Farm (later known as Animal Farm) at the start of the novel. He mistreats his animals and is regularly at the bar instead of being at home. When he's kicked out of the farm by the animals, he's ridiculed by the other farmers, and sinks into alcoholism. He tries regaining the farm but that doesn't work either. By the end of the book, it is said that he died at a home for addicts. He was written as a way to symbolize the bourgeois, or the upper class of pre-revolution Russia.</p>
