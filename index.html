        <h1>Animal Farm</h1>
            <p>
                <strong><em>Animal Farm</em></strong> is a historical fiction novel, written by George Orwell and published in 1945. It follows the story of a farm in England, whose animals decide to oust their human owner and take the farm as their own. Two of the pigs who helped in this revolution decide to take control of the farm, with one of them (Napoleon), kicking the other (Snowball) out and establishing tyrannical rule over the animals of Animal Farm. Orwell wrote this as a way to criticize the Soviet Union, who he felt had strayed away from their original principles thanks to Stalin's rule. It's been lauded as one of the greatest books ever written, especially in the historical fiction genre, and still stands as a great book. <br> <br>
                It was written in this style of fiction (fable) so that he could both use it as a way to criticize the Soviet Union and to tell a moral, "power leads to corruption".
